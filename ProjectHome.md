# As of May 1, 2013, development of jsPlumb has moved permanently to [GitHub](https://github.com/sporritt/jsPlumb) #


I'm keeping this project alive because it has a history of jsPlumb in it, but all active tickets have been moved over to GitHub, and any new tickets should be reported there.

I am updating the downloads section, though, since GitHub decided to get rid of downloads and I kind of thought they were useful.
